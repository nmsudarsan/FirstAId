To help it heal and prevent infection, gently clean the cut with water. If you have antiseptic cream or wipes, apply them to the cut. Then, cover it with a sterile bandage. Keep an eye on it, and if you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus, or if it doesn't seem to be healing, you should check with a doctor.",.gradio\flagged\Instructor Voice\76fe143ea92dbadc866f\final.wav,"[{""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Visual First Aid Instructions\\c0368b2b36ea67f6ad1f\\step_image_1.png"", ""caption"": null}, {""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Visual First Aid Instructions\\48896ac4a1cf54fd0775\\step_image_2.png"", ""caption"": null}, {""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Visual First Aid Instructions\\b2b058bbb337f5a21361\\step_image_3.png"", ""caption"": null}]",2025-05-01 19:52:14.035054
